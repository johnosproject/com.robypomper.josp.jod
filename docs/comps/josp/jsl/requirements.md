# JOSP JSL Requirements

The JSL Library is provided as a dynamic library or module depending on the
programming language. To know the language dependant requirements, please check
the corresponding section to the JSL implementation pages:

* [Java](langs/java.md#requirements)
* [HTTP APIs](langs/http.md#requirements)
* [JavaScript](langs/javascript.md#requirements)

If, on the other hand, you want to **run the JSL Shell** as part of the Java JSL
implementation, the Java Virtual Machine is required.<br/>

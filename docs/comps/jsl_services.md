# JSL Services

## John Services

Here the list of some available JOSP Services.<br/>
As tools provided by the JOSP Project we can find the Johnny Services. A set of
JOSP Services for different platforms (Web, Mobile, Voice...) that provide all
basic features required to manage JOSP Objects, Services and the user's account.<br/>
Other services are also available. For a better readability we split all other
JOSP Services in four categories based on JOSP Services types: Statistics,
Monitor & Control, Automation and Objects orchestration.

# End Users

In the JOSP EcoSystem **everybody that interact with an JOSP Object is an End User**.<br/>
Some end user interacts with object physically other digitally.
Depending on the solution there can be different types of users.
Each user types is defined as a role.

* [End Users' manual](../manuals/end_users/INDEX.md) link.

In a simple IoT Solution like the Monitor and control of a smart light, we can
identify only one user's role: the end user that would control the smart lamp
physically (via a wall switch) and digitally (via a mobile app). In a more complex
solution, like a predictive maintenance solution for industrial machines, we can
identify more roles like: the operator that would control the machinery physically
(via a wall switch) and digitally (via a mobile app); the plant supervisor that
check the machinery status from a web dashboard, the machinery's manufacturer that
analyze machinery usage, and so on...

When we design an IoT Solution, we must **identify all user's roles and how those
users will interact with our solution** (physically on objects, or digitally via
mobile app, or website...)

It is quite common for a user to adopt IoT solutions either by his own choice or
because he is obliged by the employer. In any case, **the goal in using an IoT
solution by an end user is to simplify their life** by facilitating the performance
of an activity or solving a problem.<br/>
In general, users of a IoT Solution have at least one of the following needs in
common:

* Monitoring object's statuses and their values over times<br/>
  Connected object's helps users to keep under control hundreds of sensors easily.
  Depending on what user should control, his IoT Service can show all values from object's sensors or a just a summary of those values.<br/>
  The services can also allow user to set thresholds and emits alarms when the set thresholds are exceeded.
* Remotely control object's or automate commands execution<br/>
  Remote control opens up infinite possibilities. Users can control anything from anywhere.<br/>
  Users can, for example, activate/deactivate objects or adjust their operation comfortably seated in their chair miles away.
* analyse the environment where the object is, its operation or its usage<br/>
  'Data are the new oil', understand user's needs, how they interact with objects but also the working context allow design IoT Services even more user-centred.<br/>
  Connected objects generate tons of data every day, IoT services can collect and analyse them for the user.
  Collected data and analysis performed depend on service's purpose.

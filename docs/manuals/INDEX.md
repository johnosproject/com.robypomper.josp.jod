# User Manuals

* [![End Users icon](../media/ico_enduser_9.png "End Users icon") End Users' manual](end_users/INDEX.md)
* [![Makers icon](../media/ico_maker_9.png "Makers icon") Makers' manual](makers/INDEX.md)
* [![Developers icon](../media/ico_developer_9.png "Developers icon") Developers' manual](developers/INDEX.md)

Each IoT solution require a perfect coordination between different actors:
* [Maker](/docs/actors/makers.md): how design the connected object
* [Developer](/docs/actors/developers.md): how implement the software that interact with connected objects
* [End User](/docs/actors/end_users.md): how will use objects and software created by Makers and Developers

**The JOSP EcoSystem, with his tools and guidelines, allow those actors work independently.**

Remember that in a [JOSP EcoSystem](/docs/features/ecosystem.md), the End User
is free to compose his solutions.<br/>
He can look for the [JOSP Service](/docs/features/service_integration.md) that
accomplish with his requirements *(p.e. manage smart home light, collect data
from environment sensors, perform predictive maintenance analysis...)*,
then allow desired software interact with [JOSP Object](/docs/features/objects_integration.md)
*(p.e. lights, sensor devices, industrial machines)*.

**The JOSP Docs split the JOSP user's guides by actors:**

In the End User guides you can find all day-by-day operations instructions like:
list and interact with JOSP Objects, register a new JOSP object, add/revoke JOSP
Services permissions, manage your account...

Here you can find all guides about creating a custom object or integrate existing
standard or 3rd party connected object. You can also find guidelines to help
developer to interact with your objects.

Here are explained how to use the JSL library in your software. Fom including
the library in your sources, to interact with objects. But also how to manage
object's permission or user account, etc...

# Makers user manual

Makers is the connected object's designer. More info on [actor description](/docs/actors/makers.md)
link.

Maker can be a simple enthusiast that create his own project, or be a company
that design a new connected product. Regardless of who you are, on these pages
you can find guides to learn how to create your own connected objects or
integrate existing connected objects or communication protocols/standards.

Depending on your needs these HowTos help you create a full working John Object
or a shareable JOD Distribution.
